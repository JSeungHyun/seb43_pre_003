        "content": "I was able to successfully load an HDR file into my THREE.js scene and set it as the background and environment for lighting. However, I need to rotate the HDR 180 degrees. It's my understanding that in order to achieve this I would need to create a rotational matrix and multiply that by the matrix of the HDR texture. However my attempt to do this is not rotating the HDR. I figured, if I can't rotate the HDR then I'll just rotate the whole scene. This also didn't work so it leads me to believe there is a fault in how I'm attempting to rotate the matrix.",
